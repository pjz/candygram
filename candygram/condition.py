"""A customized version of threading.Condition.

The Condition class that exists in the threading package has one problem. When
calling wait() with a timeout argument, the method does not return any
indication whether it timed out or if it was awakened by a notify(). It is
possible to make a guess at whether the method timed out or not by checking the
time after the method returns, but then one still can't be sure that a notify()
didn't come in at the last moment.

This Condition class fixes that problem by returning True if the wait() call
was awakened by a notify() and False if it timed out. The class is also
simplified by making the following assumptions:
 - There will only be one waiting thread at a time.
 - The lock need not be reentrant.
 - wait() and notify() will only be invoked by the thread that has established
   the lock.
