				Candygram is a Python implementation of Erlang concurrency
				primitives. Erlang is widely respected for its elegant built-in
				facilities for concurrent programming. This package attempts to
				emulate those facilities as closely as possible in Python. With
				Candygram, developers can send and receive messages between threads
				using semantics nearly identical to those in the Erlang language.""",
